          CHUCK is a project that continues the time-honored tradition of
          dog-themed meme coins in the crypto space. It honors the legendary
          Chuck Norris and his beloved dog, Digby. Chuck Norris, is one of the
          most meme-worthy, well-known figures in pop culture, the star of
          thirty two feature films as well as the hit TV series, Walker Texas
          Ranger. Mr. Norris is an avid lover of dogs and thus, it is fitting
          that he be honored and represented in the crypto space through $CHUCK,
          the ultimate embodiment of toughness.

          CHUCK is a community-based project that aims to bring attention to the
          BASE ecosystem. Meme coins are often seen as a gateway for everyday
          people to enter the crypto space. BASE, as a new layer two scaling
          solution for Ethereum, is widely unknown to non-crypto native
          individuals. $CHUCK aims to boost interest and activity on BASE,
          increase participation on DEXes, increase TVL on the BASE platform,
          and, ultimately, support the vision of Brian Armstrong and the
          Coinbase team. Additionally, $CHUCK aims to create a Chuck
          Norris-themed ecosystem and community, where community members have an
          opportunity to engage with one another and create fun Chuck
          Norris-inspired NFT&apos;s, merchandise and games reflective of
          1980&apos;s action films and retro gaming

          CHUCK is designed to be a fun, community-building token. Ownership of
          the $CHUCK token grants you access to the $CHUCK Telegram group and
          Chuck-Bot, a bot that grants community members access to valuable
          information within the cryptocurrency sector, such as trending coins
          and ETH gas fees. Ownership of $CHUCK token grants holders access to
          community-created NFT&apos;s, games and exclusive content.
          Additionally, $CHUCK aims to not only be a dog-themed meme coin, it
          aspires to actually benefit dogs. Every sale of $CHUCK will incur a 5%
          tax, a portion of which will be donated to Warrior Dog Foundation, a
          charitable organization designed to transition working K9&apos;s from
          an operational environment to retirement. While dog meme culture is
          pervasive in the crypto industry, $CHUCK is the first meme coin that
          sets out to actually benefit man&apos;s best friend.
